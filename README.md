# Angular Basics

### THIS REPO IS A PLAYGROUND FOR TRYING OUT ANGULAR THE FIRST TIME!!!
### What I have learnt so far:
-`@Input()`decorative: to get the custom properties passed into an el\
-`#name`: '#' with a custom name creates a `reference` to the current el\
-`@Output()` decorative: to print something custom to the console\
-`EventEmitter`: used along with `@Output`\
-`*ngFor`: iteration > render multiple data\
-`*ngIf`: render conditions\
-`<ng-template></ng-template>`: templated block\
-`#name`: a name reference to a current element (can be referred to throughout the file)
